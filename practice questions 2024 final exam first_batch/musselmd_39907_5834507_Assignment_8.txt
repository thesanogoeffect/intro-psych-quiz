*B) People from collectivist cultures are more likely to suppress their emotional reactions in social settings, emphasizing social cohesion and evaluating the most appropriate response.

1418432. How might elaborative rehearsal improve the transfer of information from short-term memory (STM) to long-term memory (LTM) compared to active rehearsal?.

*A) Elaborative rehearsal involves thinking deeply about the information and connecting it to existing knowledge, which creates stronger memory links than simple repetition in active rehearsal.
B) Elaborative rehearsal helps by increasing the repetition of information, similar to active rehearsal, but requires more frequent rehearsal to transfer information to long-term memory.
C) Active rehearsal leads to better long-term memory retention because it focuses on the exact repetition of information, unlike elaborative rehearsal, which complicates the memory process.
D) Both elaborative and active rehearsal focus on repetition, but elaborative rehearsal reduces the likelihood of information being forgotten by extending the duration of STM.

1418432. How does the interaction between nature and nurture influence personality development according to the nature versus nurture debate?.

A) Nature alone determines personality traits, while nurture shapes physical characteristics, such as height and eye color.
B) Personality traits are exclusively the result of nurture, with minimal influence from genetic factors.
*C) There is a reciprocal interaction between nature and nurture, where genetics influence how we respond to our environment, and our environment affects how genetic traits are expressed.
D) Nature and nurture operate independently, with nature influencing physical traits and nurture determining psychological and emotional traits.

1418432. How does the overjustification effect explain changes in motivation when a person begins receiving extrinsic rewards for an activity they once enjoyed intrinsically?.

A) The overjustification effect suggests that receiving extrinsic rewards enhances intrinsic motivation, leading to greater enjoyment of the activity.
*B) The overjustification effect suggests that intrinsic motivation decreases when extrinsic rewards are introduced, as the activity starts to feel like work.
C) The overjustification effect implies that extrinsic rewards have no impact on intrinsic motivation, and both types of motivation operate independently.

A) Human behavior is solely determined by the individual's internal traits, such as personality and temperament, regardless of the situation.

*C) Human behavior results from an interaction between internal factors, like personality traits, and situational factors, such as cultural influences and social roles.
D) Human behavior is unpredictable and cannot be studied effectively because both internal and situational factors are too complex to analyze.

1418432. How might a health psychologist apply their knowledge of stress to help improve public health outcomes?.

A) By researching the physiological symptoms of stress and identifying new medications to reduce stress-related illnesses.
*B) By developing interventions aimed at changing unhealthy behaviors linked to stress, such as smoking or poor diet.
C) By focusing primarily on the cognitive effects of stress, such as decision-making difficulties, to improve workplace efficiency.
D) By examining only the genetic factors that make some individuals more prone to stress-related diseases.
