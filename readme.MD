### About
Developed for TU/e with ❤️ by Jakub Werner.  
Thanks to prof. Daniël Lakens for endorsing the idea, and special thanks to Tim and Aaravee.  
This is not an official part of the TU/e course, just a passion project. I am not responsible for any mistakes or inaccuracies.  

If you want to support the project: I am looking for people who can help review flagged questions. Feel free to contact me if you're interested.

If you're interested in web design (even if you know a little, you know more than me :D) and want to help with the UI, that would be great!

## F.A.Q.:

**What exactly is this and why does it exist?**  
I wanted to create a resource for fellow P&T students after seeing previous students' submitted questions. The idea was great, but sometimes there were mistakes or the questions weren't very good. Having a platform with a voting system and verified questions (at least by an LLM) seemed like a nice idea! I hope you find it useful. The quiz is just because it's fun :)

**Can I upload my questions?**  
Unfortunately not at this time, due to potential interference with the current course format.

**What did it cost to make the app, and how did you pay for hosting?**  
Nothing so far! Thanks to Vuetify, the generous Firebase free tier, and GitHub Pages & GitHub Actions! I only pay for OpenAI tokens. If you like the project and want to attempt something similar yourself, feel free to contact me. In case you're also a student, check out the GitHub Student Pack!

**How can I contact you?**  
For any questions or suggestions, reach out to me at jakubwerner1@gmail.com or via WhatsApp. I have already implemented some of your suggestions, thanks for that!

**Did you steal the Reddit karma UI?**  
If you're from the Reddit legal team, then no, I did not.
