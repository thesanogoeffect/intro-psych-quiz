            Use the left-right arrows (or A and D keys) to navigate through
            questions.
          </li>
          <li>
            The right arrow works as a "Skip" button if you don't know the
            answer. You only get 3 skips, but you might earn more by doing well.
          </li>
          <li>
            Flag questions that seem incorrect so they can be reviewed by an LLM
            or others.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can upvote/downvote questions to improve question quality for
            everyone. If you think there is a wrong chapter, there is a report wrong chapter button next to the chapter name.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3><strong>Top menu:</strong></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You can filter questions by chapters or by source.</li>
          <li>
            There is an About page, where you can find more info and how to
            contact me if needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            The dark mode is under construction, but you can try it in the top
            menu!
          </li>
          <li>
            You can toggle the stats/info sidebars by clicking the icons on the
            sides.
          </li>
